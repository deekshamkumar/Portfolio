###  Hi, my name is Deeksha M. Kumar.


I am an avid fashion worshipper, fiction reader and data professional. I find my chronic curiousity to be my greatest strength. I spend my time learning about how things work. I have spent a good number of years working with data - starting with basic database operations and now working on analytics. I hope to keep learning how to make every story count - in businesses and beyond.
